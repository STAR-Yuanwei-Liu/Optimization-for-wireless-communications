One could run the `plot_figure3.m` directly see the simulation results. 

Some Notes:

1. `rician_fading.m` is used to generate channel coefficient.

2. noma1 and noma2 refer to different decoding order.

3. The default optimization toolbox is 'fmincon', which can also changed to CVX. Please refer to `noma_cvx.m` and `oma_cvx.m`.


Enjoy the reproducible research!
